# Futures Liquidation Price

When trading Bitcoin Futures Contracts, the allocated funds are used as collateral by the Exchange Platform in order to be able to open a position based on the desired leverage. If the asset's price moves against the position side strongly, past the liquidation price, The position is closed automatically and as a result, the collateral is used to pay the lenders and cover fees.

## Formula

The formula for calculating the liquidation price for a margin trade using currency "i" is as follows:

Here, "i" represents the currency "i", "Ai" represents the total amount of "i" assets, "Li" represents the borrowed amount of "x" asset, "Ri" represents the amount of interest payable on "x" asset, "Pi" represents the index price of the "x" asset/BTC (or USDT) pair, and finally "li" represents the liquidation price for "x" asset.

Liquidation is triggered when the risk ratio reaches the liquidation risk ratio .

Risk ratio = Total assets / (Total amount borrowed + Interest payable). Using the "i" currency as an example:

Therefore, the liquidation reference price for "i" currency is:

Ratio of the index price to the liquidation reference price = (Liquidation price - Index price) / Index price.

## Calculator

```python
# Init the position margin (USDT Balance added to the position on isolated mode)
position_margin: float = 0

# Init the BTC short/long contract quantity (Before applying leverage)
raw_contract_quantity: float = 0

# Iterate over each trade and calculate the entry price
for trade in CONFIG["position"]["trades"]:
  # Append the value to the position margin
  position_margin += trade["amount"]

  # Add the value to the raw contract quantity
  raw_contract_quantity += round(trade["amount"] / trade["price"], 8)

# Calculate the entry price
entry_price: float = round(position_margin / raw_contract_quantity, 2)

# Calculate the contract quantity (With leverage)
contract_quantity: float = round(raw_contract_quantity * CONFIG["position"]["leverage"], 8)
```

```python
# Initialize the liquidation price
liquidation_price: float = 0

# Iterate over each leverage tier until the correct level is found
for tier in CONFIG["leverage_tiers"]:
  # Init the maintenance margin rate
  maintenance_margin_rate: float = tier["maintenance_margin"] / 100

  # Calculate the liquidation price
  liquidation_price = round(
      (
        position_margin + tier["maintenance_amount"] - 
        (contract_quantity * CONFIG["position"]["side"]) * entry_price
      ) / 
      (contract_quantity * (maintenance_margin_rate - CONFIG["position"]["side"])), 
      2
  )

  # Calculate the base balance
  base_balance = liquidation_price * contract_quantity

  # If the correct tier has been found, stop the iteration
  if base_balance <= tier["max_position"]:
    break
```

```python
print("RESULT\n\n")
print(f"Number of Trades: {len(CONFIG['position']['trades'])}")
print(f"\nEntry Price: {utils.currency(entry_price)}")
print(f"\nPosition Margin: {utils.currency(position_margin)}")
print(f"\nContract Quantity: {utils.currency(raw_contract_quantity, symbol='BTC')} ({utils.currency(position_margin)}) x{CONFIG['position']['leverage']} -> {utils.currency(contract_quantity, symbol='BTC')} ({utils.currency(round(position_margin*CONFIG['position']['leverage'], 2))})")
print(f"\nLiquidation Price: {utils.currency(liquidation_price)} -> {utils.calculate_percentage_change(entry_price, liquidation_price)}% away from entry")
```

```
RESULT

Number of Trades: 7

Entry Price: 20,941.63$

Position Margin: 12,700$

Contract Quantity: 0.60644757BTC (12,700$) x10 -> 6.0644757BTC (127,000$)

Liquidation Price: 18,933.89$ -> -9.59% away from entry
